### ITV-001 - What’s your favorite use case?

Just like research, you should be up to date on what’s going on in the industry. As such, if you’re asked about use cases, make sure that you have a few examples in mind that you can share. Whenever possible, bring up your personal experiences.

You can also share what’s happening in the industry. For example, if you’re interested in the use of AI in medical images, Health IT Analytics has some interesting use cases:

Detecting Fractures And Other Musculoskeletal Injuries
Aiding In The Diagnosis Neurological Diseases
Flagging Thoracic Complications And Conditions

### ITV-002 - What conferences are you hoping to attend this year? Any keynote speeches you’re hoping to catch?

Conferences are great places to network, attend workshops, learn, and grow. So if you’re planning to stick to a career in artificial intelligence, you should be going to some of these. For example, Deep Learning World has a great one every summer.

This year’s event in Las Vegas will feature keynote speakers like Dr. Dyann Daley (founder and CEO of Predict Align Prevent), Siddha Ganju (solutions architect at Nvidia), and Dr. Alex Glushkovsky (principal data scientist at BMO Financial Group, and others).

### ITV-003 - Do you have research experience in AI?

At present, a lot of work within the AI space is research-based. As a result, many organizations will be digging into your background to ascertain what kind of experience you have in this area. If you authored or co-authored research papers or have been supervised by industry leaders, make sure to share that information.

In fact, take it a step further and have a summary of your research experience along with your research papers ready to share with the interviewing panel.

However, if you don’t have any formal research experience, have an explanation ready. For example, you can talk about how your AI journey started as a weekend hobby and grew into so much more within a space of two or three years.
