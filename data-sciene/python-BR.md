##### What is the difference between a tuple and a list in Python?
“Apart from tuples being immutable there is also a semantic distinction that should guide their usage.” 

##### What Native Data Structures Can You Name in Python?
Common native data structures in Python are as follows:

Dictionaries
Lists
Sets
Strings
Tuples


##### When Would You Use a List vs. a Tuple vs. a Set in Python?
A list is a common data type that is highly flexible. It can store a sequence of objects that are mutable, so it’s ideal for projects that demand the storage of objects that can be changed later.

A tuple is similar to a list in Python, but the key difference between them is that tuples are immutable. They also use less space than lists and can only be used as a key in a dictionary. Tuples are a perfect choice when you want a list of constants.

Sets are a collection of unique elements that are used in Python. Sets are a good option when you want to avoid duplicate elements in your list. This means that whenever you have two lists with common elements between them, you can leverage sets to eliminate them.


##### What Packages in the Standard Library, Useful for Data Science Work, Do You Know?
When Guido van Rossum created Python in the 1990s, it wasn’t built for data science. Yet, today, Python is the leading language for machine learning, predictive analytics, statistics, and simple data analytics.

This is because Python is a free and open-source language that data professionals could easily use to develop tools that would help them complete data tasks more efficiently.

The following packages in the Python Standard Library are very handy for data science projects:

NumPy

NumPy (or Numerical Python) is one of the principle packages for data science applications. It’s often used to process large multidimensional arrays, extensive collections of high-level mathematical functions, and matrices. Implementation methods also make it easy to conduct multiple operations with these objects.

There have been many improvements made over the last year that have resolved several bugs and compatibility issues. NumPy is popular because it can be used as a highly efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. It’s also an excellent library as it makes data analysis simple by processing data faster while using a lot less code than lists.

Pandas

Pandas is a Python library that provides highly flexible and powerful tools and high-level data structures for analysis. Pandas is an excellent tool for data analytics because it can translate highly complex operations with data into just one or two commands.

Pandas comes with a variety of built-in methods for combining, filtering, and grouping data. It also boasts time-series functionality that is closely followed by remarkable speed indicators.

SciPy

SciPy is another outstanding library for scientific computing. It’s based on NumPy and was created to extend its capabilities. Like NumPy, SciPy’s data structure is also a multidimensional array that’s implemented by NumPy.

The SciPy package contains powerful tools that help solve tasks related to integral calculus, linear algebra, probability theory, and much more.

Recently, this Python library went through some major build improvements in the form of continuous integration into multiple operating systems, methods, and new functions. Optimizers were also updated, and several new BLAS and LAPACK functions were wrapped.
